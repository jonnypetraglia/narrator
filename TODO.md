# Narrator TODO

Mmm whatsa saaaayy

### Todo

- [ ] Give all Loggers @invocablemethod for PB?  
- [ ] Configure Narrators by Custom Metadata  
- [ ] Create a LWC for managing LoggingSettings__mdt so that there can be a dropdown of loggers (w/ the ability to show the Logger name but save the Dev name) and, the the filter logic and whatnot  
- [ ] Test EventREST (use Mock) 
- [ ] LWC can just call apex directly, duh
- [ ] Auto truncation

### Urgent

- [ ] Set up our org-specific package
- [ ] Monitor is broken pretty sure
- [ ] How to specify recipients of emails?
- [ ] Test Utilities (hold off til I have it solidified)  

### In Progress

- [ ] Test Filter (DateTime parsing is effed up)  
- [ ] Test LogEventDelegator (just receiveEvents)  
- [ ] Test 4 Loggers  

### Done âœ“

- [x] Apex can't do 'Custom Notifications' yet so the best way is afawcett's https://github.com/afawcett/customnotificationdemo
